# odin-landingpage
Landing page project from The Odin Project to practice CSS and Flexbox

The instructions for this project have been sourced from by The Odin Project's Foundations Course (Project: Landing Page).

The assignment is to create a web page from scratch using the design that has been provided. The first image is of the complete website and the second has details about some of the fonts and colours that have been used.

The result does not need to be a pixel for pixel match but should look like the desired outcome in the full page image.

# Self Check
1. The website has four main sections and a footer.
2. Only one CSS file was used.
3. Flexbox was used to align the elements on the page.
4. The project does not need to be responsive. Just focus on making it look good on a regular computer screen.
